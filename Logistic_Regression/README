We have modeled logistic regression model from scratch using some basic python libraries.
OUr code does not involve sci-kit learn linear regression implementation.
We trained and tested our model over data from 2011 flu dataset covering 417 observation (students) with 18 features.

The repository contains 
-- python implementation of logistic regression model
-- data set and document information under Machine_learning folder
-- All the visualization generated on experimental basis while training and testing the model are stored under Visualization folder
-- A complete comprehensive documentation of this machine learning project (not user manual).
-- Each python can be executed using : python <name_of_the_file>.py on the terminal
or using pycharm or Anaconda.
