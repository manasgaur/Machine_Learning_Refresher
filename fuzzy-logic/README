Machine Learning Assignment on Fuzzy Logic. In this assignment , we developed and tested the Fuzzy Inference System on Flu dataset. 
The dataset are present under datasets folder (Data/fluML.csv, datasets/wine.csv).

The source code for the work have been pinned inside the folder "Python_notebook_souce_code". All the code is in .ipynb format with some textual content inside.
If anyone want to use the python code (not the notebook) can use ( but do remove all the texual content) :
jupyter nbconvert --to script <name of the file>.ipynb <name of the file>.py

For testing the source code :
cd fuzzy-logic
type : jupyter notebook

Information about the subfolder under fuzzy-logic:
Python_notebook_souce_code : Contains 5 source code : 

1. myFuzzy.ipynb  : this is an experimental python notebook created for experiments. 

2. Trimf_experiment.ipynb : this python notebook contains source code of creating a fuzzy inference system using Triangular Membership Function.

3. trapmf_experiment.ipynb : this python notebook contains source code of creating a fuzzy inference system using Trapezoidal Membership Function.

4. gaussmf_experiment_split.ipynb : this python notebook contains source code of creating a fuzzy inference system using Gaussian Membership Function. The word "split" in the name of the source code file states that in this program, we split the feature values dataset into three categories : Low ("lo"), Medium ("md"), and High ("hi"). Similar to previous experiments.

5. gaussmf_experiment_no_split.ipynb : this python notebook contains source code of creating a fuzzy inference system using Gaussian Membership Function. In this, we do not split the dataset into three categories. 

images : all the plots and snapshots taken during the experiments
docs : contains the assignment information and the report generated as a result of the large number of experiments performed using Fuzzy Logic. It is quite detailed and explanatory.

The source code in this repository is for understanding and practice. There are various statements which are commented. You can uncommment them to see their impact on the results of the FIS System. The project, used both MATLAB fuzzy logic and Sci-kit Fuzzy.
